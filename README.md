# Keymapping
How broke am I ? Mf, i am using mapping instead buying new keyboard :)

Joke apart, repo for mapping key's if i forgot in future

## Step's

```
git clone https://github.com/rvaiya/keyd.git
cd keyd
make && sudo make install
sudo systemctl enable keyd && sudo systemctl start keyd
```

> sudo nano /etc/keyd/default.conf

then Change the word that doesn't work with less usable key 

Like e,3 and many other doesn't Work in my Keyboard so i i have mapped it accordingly,,..

[main]
f2 = e
f5 = 3

shift+f2 = E
shift+f5 = #




Now to type  "e"  you should tap f2 button and similarly other
